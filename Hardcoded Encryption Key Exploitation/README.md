# Hardcoded AES Key Exploitation Project
## Requirements
### Install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Project Objective

This project demonstrates the exploitation of a server application that uses a hardcoded AES encryption key to encrypt messages. By analyzing the implementation, we retrieve the encrypted message and decrypt it offline using the same hardcoded key.

## Features

- Exploit a hardcoded AES encryption key to decrypt sensitive data.
- Simulate the decryption process offline.
- Highlight the risks of hardcoding cryptographic keys in applications.

## How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Start the Server

Run the server application:
```bash
python server.py
```

### Step 2: Send Data Using the Client
Run the client application to send plaintext data to the server:

```bash
python client.py 
```
### Step 3: Retrieve the Encrypted Message
Copy the encrypted message displayed by the client.

### Step 4: Run the Exploit Script
Use the exploit.py script to decrypt the message offline:
```bash
python exploit.py
```

# Key Points
## Understanding the Vulnerability:
Hardcoding cryptographic keys is a severe security vulnerability.
If the key is leaked or reverse-engineered, encrypted data can be easily decrypted.

## Suggestions for Improvement:
Replace hardcoded keys with a secure key exchange mechanism (e.g., Diffie-Hellman or RSA).
Rotate keys periodically to limit exposure in case of a leak.

## Learning Outcomes:
Learn how attackers exploit hardcoded keys.
Understand best practices for secure cryptographic implementations.

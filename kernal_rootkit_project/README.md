# Kernel Module Project: Rootkit-like Features
 To be ran on Linux Machines.
## Overview
This repository demonstrates how to create custom Linux kernel modules, 
exploring concepts like hiding processes and hooking system calls for educational purposes.

## Features
- Basic kernel module structure.
- Module hiding from `/proc/modules`.
- Hooking system calls (e.g., `open`).

## Prerequisites
- Linux with kernel headers installed.
- `gcc`, `make`, and `gdb`.

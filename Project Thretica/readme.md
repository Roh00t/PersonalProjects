# Thretica
# Author: Rohit Panda
> 🧠 Simulating the Minds Behind the Breach

Thretica is an advanced cybersecurity simulation platform that models the decision-making behavior of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors. By integrating behavioral science, cognitive modeling, and AI-driven attack logic, Thretica helps security teams anticipate, visualize, and respond to sophisticated threat actor strategies in real-time.

## 🧭 Project Vision

To empower cybersecurity teams and researchers with tools that replicate the cognitive pathways of human attackers, enabling the creation of proactive, adaptive defense mechanisms in enterprise environments.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔬 **Cognitive Threat Simulation**  
  Models APT behavior using rule-based systems and agent-based modeling.
- 🧠 **Attacker Profiling Engine**  
  Simulates tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) based on known APT groups.
- 📊 **Behavioral Visualizations**  
  Dynamic graphs showing attack paths, decision trees, and cognitive biases.
- 🧪 **Interactive Sandbox Mode**  
  Security teams can simulate attack/defense scenarios in a controlled environment.
- 📡 **Threat Scenario Library**  
  Real-world use cases built from MITRE ATT&CK and open-source incident data.
